# Oculis AI Chatbot

Oculis AI is an interactive chatbot application built using Streamlit, designed to provide engaging and mood-specific responses. The chatbot leverages the Gemini model to deliver dynamic dialogue tailored to user inputs, allowing for both text and voice interaction. The chatbot learns from user interactions over time, adapting to specific vocabulary and preferences.

## Features

- **Interactive User Interface**: Built using Streamlit for a smooth user experience.
- **Mood-Specific Responses**: Users can select from various moods (Normal, Technical, Funny, etc.) to tailor the chatbotâ€™s responses.
- **Voice Input and Output**: Supports voice input through the microphone, making interactions hands-free.
- **User Learning Module**: Analyzes user input to adapt to personalized vocabulary and preferences.
- **Chat History**: Keeps a record of user interactions for continuity and context.
